Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse or iterate elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

Iterator pattern is not only about traversing through a collection, we can provide different kind of iterators based on our requirements. Iterator design pattern hides the actual implementation of traversal through the collection and client programs just use iterator methods.
